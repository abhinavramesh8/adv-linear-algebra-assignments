# Advanced Linear Algebra Assignments

These are my solutions to the assignments that were a part of the advanced linear algebra course in my master's. These assignments were about implementing numerical linear algebra algorithms using MATLAB. The algorithms involved in each of the five assignemnts are as follows:

1. LQ factorization of a matrix(rows are linearly independent) using Householder transformations

2. Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Iteration

3. Method of Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient Method with and without preconditioning

4. Inverse Power Method, Shifted Inverse Power Method and Rayleigh Quotient Iteration

5. SVD of a square matrix by reduction to bidiagonal form followed by Francis updates
